Basics of Animations and Flexbox in CSS

CSS provides powerful tools for creating responsive layouts and engaging user experiences with Flexbox and Animations. 

Flexbox is a layout model that arranges items in a container, either horizontally (row) or vertically (column), with properties like justify-content, align-items, and flex. It ensures flexibility and responsiveness in layouts. 

Animations in CSS enable smooth transitions and dynamic effects using @keyframes. Combined with properties like animation-name, animation-duration, and animation-timing-function, they bring elements to life. Together, Flexbox and Animations enhance design by ensuring adaptive layouts and captivating visual effects, making them essential tools for modern web development.
